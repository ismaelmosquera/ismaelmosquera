#### **About me**  

Ismael Mosquera Rivera has a degree in Computer Science by [Pompeu Fabra University](https://www.upf.edu), Barcelona - Spain.  
He was involved in the [CLAM-project](http://www.clam-project.org) C++ Library for Audio and Music.  
Unfortunately, he is affected by a severe eye disease ( Retinitis Pigmenthosa ), which caused him to get totally blind a number of years  
ago. Anyway, he finally decided to get back to the computer world, so, he installed a screen reader in his old computer.  
The one he installed is only available for Windows OS, but he got the MinGW compiler which has also a command line shell from where you  
can have a little Linux in your Windows system. So, all the textual information in a computer can be read, and he began to do research.  
Among the things he has done since then, there are some contributions on GitHub.  
He is, currently, interesting in Audio and MIDI programming.
